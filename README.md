Analysis and visualization of zebrafish behavior under a psychedelic

### TO-DO
1. write out the readme.md for package requirements
2. comment the behaviorTracking protocols
3. plot time spent in center
4. bout_angle and bout_duration histograms: normalize AUC to 1
5. normalize distance and dist_from_center to egg water
6. plot variance in distance per concentration with normalized baseline and drugtreated
7. plot average velocity over time per concentration
8. plot average angular velocity
9. run stats per timebin
